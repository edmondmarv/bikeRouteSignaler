***Bike Signaling Device Description (working device)***

Welcome to the bikeRouteSignaler wiki! - Marvin Edmond (me378) & Rebecca Lassman (rsl252)

We created a device that mimics common hand signals cyclists use to signal turning. Typically on a bike to signal a turn the cyclist will stick their arm out to the left if turning left or the right if turning right.

However, using your arm to signal can pose a handful of challenges:

The cyclist has less control over the bike with only one hand on the handle bars. This means if something happens suddenly they can not quickly grab their breaks or make a fast turn. This is even more problematic for new cyclists who may not yet be able to balance/ride with one hand at all.
A car's turn signals light up making them easier to see. It can be hard to notice a cyclist sticking out their arm in broad daylight, and it's even more difficult or maybe impossible to see in rain/fog or at night.
To solve these problems we developed an automated turn signal for cyclists. The device has two parts. The first is a small box that gets mounted on the bike handlebars and has left and right buttons. The second part is a reflective vest with a turn signal (mock arm and hand wrapped in neon tape) mounted on the back.

When the cyclist presses the left or right button on the box mounted on the handle bars, the turn signal on the back rotates in the specified direction mimicking the action of sticking out your arm.

But in this case the 'arm' allows the cyclist to keep both hands on the handlebars and the neon coating makes it easier for cars to detect. Once the directional button is pressed, the 'arm' remains pointing in the specified direction for 5 seconds then returns to the middle (or straight) position until the next direction is specified.
